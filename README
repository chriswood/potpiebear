I'm using the potpiebear app to implement a setup of a central sidus server. So the sidus code will live and run on user's local machines, which will handle updating the central db. This will be the code that will run where people can view details about other people's itunes and stuff. So someone will set up this central server and the views to its data, then anyone can install sidus on their local machine and access this. Eventually it would be cool to seperate the needed sidus central handler out of this, and not have it tied to the fastcgi django app. But that would only be useful if someone doesn't want to build their own views. I guess they could then use my shitty ones :D
